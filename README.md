# react-hook-form demo

Experiments with using `react-hook-form` with MUI and Tailwind components.

- Includes a validation scheme built using `nope` (a smaller alternative to
  `yup`). There are many other validators to choose from.
- The MUI examples use the `react-hook-form` `control` pattern to manage
  controlled components.
- The Tailwind example uses `register` and keeps the code as simple as possible
  while still offering custom validation.
